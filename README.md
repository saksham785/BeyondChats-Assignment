# Reddit User Persona Generator 

This project was built as part of the assignment for the **AI/LLM Engineer Internship at BeyondChats**. The task was to take a Reddit user profile, analyze their posts and comments, and generate a detailed **user persona** with key insights like:

- Behavioral traits  
- Interests  
- Goals  
- Needs  
- Motivations  

...with direct citations from the user's own posts or comments.

## Why I Chose a Jupyter Notebook (and Not a `.py` Script)

Even though the assignment asked for an executable script, I decided to use a **Colab-compatible Jupyter Notebook** for a few reasons:

- It better reflects how I think through problems step by step  
- It makes the entire pipeline like scraping, summarizing, interpreting more visible and interactive  
- It's easier to experiment and tune models or parameters on the fly  
- It allows for secure credential handling using `getpass()` or `userdata.get()` rather than hardcoding anything

That said, all logic is modularized and can easily be converted into a `.py` script if needed.

## What This Project Does

1. Takes a Reddit profile URL (e.g., `https://www.reddit.com/user/kojied/`)
2. Scrapes the user's most recent 100 posts and 100 comments using Reddit's API
3. Uses a lightweight summarization model to condense each entry
4. Analyzes and classifies summaries into:
   - Traits
   - Interests
   - Needs
   - Goals
   - Motivations
5. Outputs a `.txt` file with the final persona, citing sources for each insight

## Notes on the Language Model Used

To stay within resource and quota limits, this version uses a **lightweight LLM (`distilbart` from HuggingFace)** for summarization.

While this model is effective for basic summarization, it doesn't have the deep contextual understanding that more powerful models like **GPT-4** or **Claude** offer.

> ðŸ“Œ **Using a stronger LLM** would significantly improve persona quality â€” especially in:
- Recognizing subtle behavioral cues
- Differentiating sarcasm, humor, or emotional tone
- Inferring deeper psychological patterns

This trade-off was a conscious decision to ensure the notebook is easy to run even without an OpenAI key.

## Tech Stack

- `praw` â€“ Reddit API wrapper for scraping
- `transformers` â€“ for summarization using `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6`
- `tqdm` â€“ for progress bars
- `getpass` / `userdata.get()` â€“ for secure, interactive credential input

## How to Use (Colab or Jupyter)

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter  
2. When prompted, securely input your Reddit API credentials  
3. Paste a Reddit profile URL  
4. Run the notebook  
5. Download the final persona `.txt` file from the `output/` folder

## Future Work (If Time Permitted)

- Add Named Entity Recognition (NER) and emotion analysis
- Use a more advanced LLM like GPT-4 or Claude 3 for deeper understanding
- Create an interactive Streamlit or Gradio web app
- Include visual persona summary or infographic export
